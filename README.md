### AeroNotes
AeroNotes is a MERN stack notes application for creating, managing, and organizing personal notes. This project is also a learning platform to understand full-stack development concepts.

## Features (Current Stage)
- Backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- Mongoose schemas for Users and Notes
- Basic API routes: auth and notes
- Frontend bootstrapped with Create React App
- Easy testing using Thunder Client

## Getting Started

### Backend
#### Install dependencies:
`npm install`

### Frontend

`npm install`

#### Start React development server:

## Next Steps
- Implement authentication & authorization
- Refine Mongoose schemas
- Connect frontend with backend APIs
- Add full CRUD operations for notes
